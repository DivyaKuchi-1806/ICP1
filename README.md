# Web_Introduction

The main purpose of creating this repository is to get the understanding on how to create the folders and upload the files into the repository. as well as, how to commit, push, pull...etc. As part of this i have created the two folders, Source code and Documentation. In source code folder, we have the index.html file. and in the documentation folder we have the screenshots.
